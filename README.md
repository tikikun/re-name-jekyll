# To rename the file in Jekyll
Do you ever getting tired of name the md file every fucking time you want to deliver a new post?
Yeah! So now you don't have to do it anymore, this python code will do it for you

~~~ terminal
$ python3 re_name.py YOUR_FILE_HERE
~~~

create a folder, for example prepare_folder inside your _posts
through every posts you have into that folder
_posts/prepare_folder
the script will through the files back into _posts


#### This is still in developing process
